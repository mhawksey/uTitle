ABOUT

uTitleis an experimental tool which uses Twitter to allow users to make free and timeline based comments on YouTube videos. The original concept is explained in detail in this blog post http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.org.uk/mashe/2010/06/convergence-youtube-meets-twitter-in-timeline-commenting-of-youtube-videos-using-twitter-utitle/, but the basic idea is video are played in custom interface which lets users 'tweet' comments. Part of each tweet includes a hashtag linking it to a specific YouTube video and a timestamp from the current point in the video. Tweets are stored in TwapperKeepr and temporarily cached in uTitle. When a video is replayed in the uTitle interface existing comments appear at the timed points as subtitles and users can also use the timed tweets to jump to part of the video (see this video for a demonstration http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVp2F6tDWfw).
